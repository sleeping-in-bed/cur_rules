# Instructions
1. Rules prefixed with ! are the most important.

# General Rules

1. You must respond in Simplified Chinese.
2. Code comments must use English, unless another language is explicitly requested.
3. Every time you modify code, you must check the current code in the file and make changes based on the existing code, as I may have already modified and optimized it.
4. Do not write meaningless comments such as "what was changed this time, where it was modified".
5. The code written must be easy to test, for example, by using principles like "dependency injection", "separation of concerns", and "pure functions".
6. When I say create an example, it should be the simplest possible example by default, unless I specify what kind of example to create.
7. !You should only modify the minimum number of lines of code necessary to complete the specified task,
   and preserve the rest of the file (including formatting, style, structure, and logic) as much as possible.

# Docker Rules
1. Use the `docker compose` command and `compose.yml`. The `compose.yml` should use the latest syntax; do not write the `version` field.
2. Do not change the docker image versions in the files.
3. The `restart` field should be `unless-stopped`.
4. Do not use the `container_name` or `networks` fields.
5. When using environment variables, do not provide default values, e.g., `${PORT:-80}`.
6. When writing a `Dockerfile` or `compose.yml`, you must check the existing images on the current host and use their versions.

# Python Rules
1. Type hints are mandatory in the code. Type hints must be very detailed and pass `mypy` checks.
   Variables whose types are difficult to infer must also have their types specified, for example, when the returning function does not specify its return type.
2. When creating complex and explicit data structures, prefer using a Pydantic `Model`.
3. Sensitive configurations must be separated and placed in a `.env` file, loaded using the `python-dotenv` library,
   and read using the `os` library. Where an environment variable must be set, use `os.environ[]` to read it to prevent the user from forgetting to configure it.
4. Do not write useless exception handling, such as only printing a message in the exception block,
   unless you genuinely recommend it. Otherwise, only write exception handling when it can actually resolve the exception.
5. The project uses the `uv` package manager for dependency management. Use `uv add` to install packages.
6. The project uses `pytest` for testing, located in the `tests` folder in the project root directory.
7. Do not use `print`; use `loguru` instead.
8. Use `pathlib` instead of `os.path`.
9. When asked to fix lint issues, call `ruff format && ruff check --fix`, then review the issues and fix them. When fixing,
  do not "fix for the sake of fixing." Only apply fixes that absolutely do not affect existing functionality. If a fix might cause problems, you can choose not to apply it.

# Python Docstring Rules
1. Write Google-style docstrings at the beginning of files, classes, and in every function.
2. A standard example:
    """Raise a ValueError if the provided value is negative.

    It demonstrates how to document exceptions in a docstring.

    Args:
        value: An integer value.

    Returns:
        A string representation of the value.

    Yields:
        Integers from 0 to n-1.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the value is negative.

    """
3. Common docstring lint errors:
  - (D200) One-line docstring should fit on one line
  - (D401) First line of docstring should be in imperative mood
  - (D404) First word of the docstring should not be "This"
  - (D413) Missing blank line after last section ("Returns")

# Python Package Versions
1. The Python version is 3.12 or higher. Use new syntax (e.g., the `|` symbol for type unions).
2. The Pydantic version is 2.10 or higher.
3. The FastAPI version is 0.115 or higher.
4. For other library version requirements, please refer to the project's `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` file.
